            <h2>Back to the Idea of HipHop</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Peace. Love. Unity. Having Fun.</strong> We at BeHop believe in the very basics of HipHop. 
                When we talk about HipHop, we are talking about the whole culture. 
                A culture that inspires us to always thrive for keeping our standards high. 
                Our Mission: To embrace youth empowerment, diversity and creativity within our fashion.

            <h3>Gender Neutrality as a Brand</h3>
            <p>
                We at BeHop believe in diversity– That’s why we make sure everyone has an equal 
                chance to express themselves through fashion. We want fashion to reflect on your personality, 
                not your body. That’s why our clothes resemble who you really are inside – Colorful, confident 
                and true to yourself. Our clothes are gender neutral. 
            </p>

            <h3>Fashion for Everybody</h3>
            <p>
                It’s important for us to promote a healthy body image. 
                We’re not about conforming to any stereotypes, so we work with models of any race, 
                gender and size to represent our audience. Thus, our photographers at BeHop do not believe in digitally altering, 
                reshaping or retouching either. After all, we care about making our website accessible for people with special needs.

            <h3>The Creators</h3>
            <p>
                Empowered, diverse and inclusive – Our team of employees resemble our mission as a brand. 
                Founded by two young, inexperienced entrepreneurs Anton Bespalov and Michael Hopp, we are not afraid to be innovative 
                while being provocative as we dare to make big leaps and take big risks to achieve our mission in diminishing gender segregation.
